### Super Yacht Times

## Technical Assignment

Design: 
I sent you a Figma invite, and also the link here. The Figma file contains some additional comments regarding the page details. The design only includes a desktop version, so you can disregard a potential mobile version for now.

Story:
As a visitor of a yacht profile on the SuperYacht Times website, I’d like to be presented with a gallery of all the images of the yacht. When I click on an image, I’d like to be able to view the image in a large (lightbox) overlay.

Definition of done:

- A react application, containing a gallery component
- The gallery renders, given a list of images, a grid according to the design
- The grid can accommodate both landscape and portrait images, without distorting their aspect ratio
- When a user clicks on a photo, a lightbox opens to view the gallery in large format
